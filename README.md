# 👋 Hi there, I’m Shivam Padmani

🎓 Currently pursuing my Master's at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), with a deep interest in exploring the **intersection of physics, mechanics, and deep learning**.

🧠 My research revolves around:
- Mechanical analogs of Neural Networks
- Generative models (GANs, VAEs, Diffusion Models)
- Conditional and adversarial architectures
- Computational modeling and scientific insight

💡 I’m driven by the goal of building models that are not just accurate, but interpretable and grounded in physical intuition.

## 🚀 Recent Projects
- **Mechanical Equivalents of Neural Networks** – A research exploration of how neural network architectures can be interpreted using mechanical systems.
- **Conditional GAN with Reconstruction Loss** – A hybrid GAN-decoder model trained with class-conditional constraints and reconstruction supervision.
- **Diffusion Models with Classifier Guidance** – Built a classifier-guided DDPM and experimented with unconditional and conditional UNet variants.
- **Beta-VAE Experiments** – Explored disentanglement by varying the beta parameter in VAE training on natural RGB images.
- **Adversarial Autoencoder** – Designed an AAE to explore latent space structures in real-world image datasets.

## 📜 Early Works (Before IISc)
- **Steam Table Property Prediction using ANN**
- **Screw and Nut Detection using Image Processing**
- **Brain Tumor Classification (Coursera Guided Project)**
- **Generalized Reduced Gradient (GRG) Method in Python**
- **Mohr Circle and Principal Stress Calculator (HTML/CSS/JS)**
- **Moment of Inertia Calculator for Standard Sections (HTML/CSS/JS)**
- **Trigonometric Calculator in C++**
